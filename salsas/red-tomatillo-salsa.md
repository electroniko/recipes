### Ingredients:

* 1 pound small tomatillos
* Handful of arbol peppers
* 1 clove garlic
* Salt to taste
* 1/4 cup water, can reduce to 2/3 tbsp if less watery salsa desired

### Steps:

- Cut tips off arbol peppers and fry in oil on low-medium heat (3/10)
- Once arbol peppers start to turn black slightly, turn off and set aside
- Peel and wash tomatillos
- Roast (no oil) tomatillos on medium heat (5/10) until they turn brownish orange and become soft
- Blend arbol peppers, tomatillos, garlic, salt, and water until smooth

You can also boil the tomatillos instead of roasting, for a different flavour
